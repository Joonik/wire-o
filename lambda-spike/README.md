# Superglue: AWS Lambda Spike

## Upload Lambda to AWS Using the AWS CLI

You can use the AWS Console, but the AWS CLI allows for the scripting of Lambda uploads. Here's how to get it:
1. Install pip first if you don't have it already with `sudo easy_install pip` (on Mac OSX)
2. Install the CLI with `pip install awscli`


Now you can zip and deploy:
run `./zip_it.sh` (script only zips things, doesn't upload, right now)
